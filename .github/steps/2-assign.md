## Step 2: Assign an issue

There are several important issues to get done before we leave, but let's do a test run on one of the simple options first. This will let us see how interactions and collaboration work, so we can update our docs for guiding the other teachers. Most don't know how to use a traditional coding editor!

#### Key features

- A normal issue/PR workflow.
- Uses GitHub Actions.

> [!TIP]
> Keep an issue's goal short. Remember an Actions workflow has a duration limit.

### Security considerations

- Hidden content, like comments, is ignored
- Only users with write access can assign an issue.
- Impact on GitHub Actions minutes usage.

> [!Note]
> Free accounts have a limited amount of Actions minutes.
