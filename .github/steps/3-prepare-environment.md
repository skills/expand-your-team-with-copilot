## Step 3: Preparing Copilot's environment

In this step, you'll customize Copilot's environment so it can work effectively for your school's project.

Let's learn what are the different ways you can customize the Copilot Coding Agent's behaviour so it makes future development smoother for everyone! :rocket:

### üìñ Theory: Customizing Copilot's development environment

Copilot's environment can be customized in several ways, each serving a different purpose:

| Option                      | What it does                                                                    | How to provide this customization                                     |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| üìù **Copilot Instructions** | Provide project-specific context and guidance for Copilot for it's session      | Add details to `.github/copilot-instructions.md`                      |
| ‚öôÔ∏è **Copilot Setup Steps**  | Pre-configure the coding agent session with all required tools and dependencies | Configure `.github/workflows/copilot-setup-steps.yml` workflow file                   |
| üåé **Environment**          | Provide configuration and secret values that the Agent might need               | This is available in **Repository settings ‚Üí Environments ‚Üí copilot** |
| üß© **MCP Servers**          | Extend Copilot's capabilities with custom Model Context Protocol servers.       | This is available in **Repository settings ‚Üí Copilot ‚Üí Coding Agent** |

> [!NOTE]
> The Copilot Coding Agent comes with [GitHub](https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server) and [Playwright](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-mcp) MCP servers preinstalled. By default Coding Agent sessions only have access to read only action of the GitHub MCP server. This can be customized ([read more](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/copilot/how-tos/use-copilot-agents/coding-agent/extend-coding-agent-with-mcp#customizing-the-built-in-github-mcp-server))

### ‚å®Ô∏è Activity: Create instructions to guide Copilot

You'll write Copilot instructions that include details about your school, the roles Copilot should assume, and the common tasks teachers request. This will help Copilot interact more naturally and support your team effectively.

1. In the top navigation, select the **Code** tab.

1. Create a new branch with the name `prepare-environment`.

   <img width="250" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c48deded-4214-4edd-9a50-d1368bfb12e8" />

1. Navigate to and open the `.github/copilot-instructions.md` file for editing.

1. Replace the placeholder text with a link to the development guide.

   ```md
   ## Development Environment

   For detailed setup and development instructions, please refer to our [Development Guide](../docs/how-to-develop.md).
   ```

1. Add some additional information about the school and teachers to help Copilot interact more naturally.

   ```md
   ### User Interaction

   Consider the following when communicating with the staff.

   - The staff is not technical. Explain in simple terms as much as possible and avoid software jargon.
   - Any new code must be easy to maintain and understand, without significant coding experience.

   ## Program architecture

   - The website users are the students and teachers. Make sure the user experience is simple.
   - Do not make additional apps or services.
   - Do not make command line tools.
   - Do not create a long single file application. Always use an easy-to-understand directory structure.
   - Only use HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Python. No other languages.
   ```

   > üí° Tip: You can add more details. Check out the `copilot-instructions-ext.md` file for ideas.

1. When finished, **commit your changes** to the `prepare-environment` branch.

### ‚å®Ô∏è Activity: Prepare the coding environment for copilot

Customizing Copilot's development environment and adjusting [permissions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/choosing-what-your-workflow-does/controlling-permissions-for-github_token) is done with a unique [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) workflow. For all configuration options, see the [pre-installing dependencies for Copilot](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/copilot/how-tos/use-copilot-agents/coding-agent/customize-the-agent-environment#preinstalling-tools-or-dependencies-in-copilots-environment) documentation.

1. Ensure you are still on the `prepare-environment` branch.

1. Navigate to the `.github/workflows/` directory.

1. In the top right, click the **Add file** button and select **Create new file**.

   <img width="250" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c135dd3f-72bd-4d2b-b21f-9c4968a06f5f" />

1. Set the file name to `copilot-setup-steps.yml`.

   <img width="650" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ac615290-1045-45a5-8201-637721ef6fd2" />

1. Paste the following workflow configuration, which will pre-install the dependencies for the website's Python backend.

   ```yml
   name: "Copilot Setup Steps"

   on: workflow_dispatch
   jobs:
     # This is the required job name. If different, Copilot will ignore it.
     copilot-setup-steps:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest

       # Grant Copilot early access to read the repository content.
       permissions:
         contents: read

       steps:
         - name: Checkout code
           uses: actions/checkout@v5

         - name: Set up Python
           uses: actions/setup-python@v6
           with:
             python-version: "3.13"
             cache: "pip"

         - name: Install Python dependencies
           run: |
             python -m pip install --upgrade pip
             pip install -r src/requirements.txt
   ```

   > ü™ß **Note:** Copilot will automatically retrieve the repository contents later. This workflow provides early access during setup to install the dependencies.

   > ü™ß **Note:** Copilot will automatically identify and install missing dependencies. Doing it now saves Copilot time and ensures proper environment setup

1. In the top right, click the **Commit changes...** button and commit your changes to the `prepare-environment` branch.

1. Create a **pull request**, but do **NOT** merge it yet. Mona will check your files to confirm they are correct.

1. After Mona shares the next steps, you can merge the pull request.

> üôã **Question:** How did the manual process feel compared to letting Copilot do most of the work? ü§î

<details>
<summary>ü§∑ Having trouble?</summary><br/>

If you accidentally merged the pull request before Mona shared feedback about mistakes, that is ok. Just recreate the branch and try again with a new pull request.
