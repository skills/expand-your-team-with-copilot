## Step 4: Play time! 🤾 🏄

Now, with Copilot's workspace prepared, let's work on some more complex issues to make the Extra curricular Activities website even better! Let's see what our new coding agent can do!

Let's try the following:

1. Add issue templates
1. Make the interface prettier.
1. Add filters.

### ⌨️ Activity: Add issue templates for repeating tasks

Adding some templates should allow any teacher to easily ask Copilot to handle common tasks. In fact, let's have Copilot suggest the templates, making sure to use best practices about collecting the right amount of context. We can always adjust them later if needed!

1. In the top navigation, select the **Issues** tab.

1. Find and open issue titled `Simplify Change requests for teachers`.

1. Assign it to Copilot and switch to the created pull request.

1. Scroll down and click the **View Session** button to watch Copilot's live progress. Alternately, go take a quick break. ☕️

1. (optional) Modify the templates Copilot provided.

1. Click the **Ready for Review** button to activate Copilot's draft pull request.

1. Merge the results. Wow, that was easy! Right?! 🥹

### ⌨️ Activity: Try implementing 2 issues simultaneously 🤯

1. In the top navigation, select the **Issues** tab.

1. Find the the following 2 issues and open each in a new tab.

   - `Difficulty Tracks`

   - `Outdated Docs`

1. With both tabs open, assign both to Copilot simultaneously.

1. In both, navigate to the created pull request.

1. In both, scroll down and click the **View Session** button to watch Copilot's live progress. Alternately, go take a quick break (again!). ☕️

1. Change both from draft mode and then merge them. 😍

1. Nice work! With at least 1 pull request merged, Mona should be checking your work and preparing your final review.

> Working on multiple issues in parallel is an art-form. 🎨  
> Make sure you keep them independant to avoid merge conflicts! 😱

### ⌨️ (optional) Activity: Try using the issue templates

1. In the top navigation, select the **Issues** tab.

1. In the top right, click the **New issue** button to show the templates.

1. Role play as a teacher. Describe a potential new feature, bug, or activity.
