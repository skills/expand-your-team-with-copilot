## Step 4: Play time! 🤾 🏄

Now, with Copilot's workspace prepared, let's add some more complex issues and see what our new coding agent can do. Let's try the following:

1. Add issue templates
1. Make the interface prettier.
1. Add filters.

which should allow any teacher to easily ask Copilot to handle common tasks. In fact, let's have Copilot suggest the templates, making sure to use best practices about collecting the right amount of context. We can always adjust them if needed!

### ⌨️ Activity: Add issue templates for repeating tasks

1. In the top navigation, select the **Issues** tab.
1. Find and open issue titled `Simplify Change requests for teachers`.
1. Assign it to Copilot.
1. Wait for Copilot complete and review the work.
1. Merge the results.

### ⌨️ Activity: Try running implementing 2 issues simultaneously 🤯

1. In the top navigation, select the **Issues** tab.
1. Find the the following 2 issues and open each in a new tab.
   - `Prettier Interface`.
   - `Hard to change activities`
1. With both tabs open, assign both to Copilot simultaneously.
1. Wait for both to finish.
1. Merge one and then the other.

### ⌨️ (optional) Activity: Try using the issue templates

1. In the top navigation, select the **Issues** tab.

1. In the top right, click the **New issue** button to show the templates.

1. Role play as a teacher. Describe a potential new feature, bug, or activity.
   > Ttip: You can assign the issue to Copilot while creating the issue.
